    <h1>Perfect Pot Stickers</h1>
    <img src="/home/avtor/odin-recipes/pics/potstickers.webp">
    <p>These pot stickers made with homemade dough and filled with ground pork, ginger, garlic, and cabbage are so versatile — you can fill them with anything you want and as full as you want. The dumplings are fried and steamed, then fried again until golden and perfectly crispy on the bottom for a truly unique dumpling.</p>
    <p>Whether served as an appetizer or full-blown main dish, pot stickers are always a winning choice. Packed with savory flavors, Chef John's pot stickers are a little different because they're fried, steamed, and fried again for a delightfully crispy bottom with a tender, juicy filling.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <p>Filling</p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound ground pork</li>
        <li>4 cloves minced garlic</li>
        <li>½ cup finely chopped green onions</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons very finely minced fresh ginger</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sesame oil</li>
        <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups finely chopped green cabbage</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Dough:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>2 ½ cups all-purpose flour, or more as needed</li>
        <li>¾ teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 cup hot water, about 130 -150 F (55-65 C)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Dipping Sause:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>¼ cup seasoned rice vinegar</li>
        <li>¼ cup soy sauce</li>
    </ul>

    <p>For Frying:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>6 tablespoons vegetable oil for frying, or as needed - divided</li>
        <li>8 tablespoons water for steaming, divided</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place ground pork, green onions, garlic, ginger, 2 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon soy sauce, sesame oil, and cayenne in a mixing bowl. Top with chopped green cabbage. Mix with fork until thoroughly combined. Tamp down lightly; cover with plastic. Refrigerate until chilled, about an hour. </li>
        <li>Place 2 1/2 cups of flour and kosher salt in a mixing bowl. Slowly pour in hot water. Stir with a wooden spoon until mixture forms a shaggy dough. Flour your hands and transfer dough to a work surface. Knead dough until it becomes smooth and elastic, about 3 to 5 minutes. If dough seems too sticky, sprinkle with a bit more flour, up to an additional 1/2 cup, and continue to knead. Wrap dough ball in plastic, and let it rest about 30 minutes. </li>
        <li>When dough has rested, divide into 4 equal pieces. Cover 3 pieces with a dish cloth while you work the first piece. Roll into a small log about the thickness of a thumb, about 3/4 inch. Divide each log into 6 equal pieces. Roll each piece into a thin 3 1/2-inch circle on a lightly floured surface to form the pot sticker wrappers. Repeat with the remaining dough pieces. </li>
        <li>Lightly moisten the edges of a wrapper with your wet finger. Place a small scoop of the ground pork mixture onto the center of a wrapper. Fold up the 2 sides and pinch together in the center. Pinch together the remaining edges, forming "pleats" along one side. Tap the pot sticker on the work surface to slightly flatten the bottom; form a slight curve in it so it stands upright in the pan. Transfer to a well-floured plate. Repeat with remaining dough and filling. </li>
        <li>Mix together seasoned rice vinegar and soy sauce in a small mixing bowl for the dipping sauce. </li>
        <li>Heat oil in skillet over medium-high heat. Place about 6 or 7 pot stickers in the hot oil, flat side down. Cook until bottoms are golden brown, about 2 minutes. Drizzle in water and quickly cover the pan; steam for 3 minutes. Uncover; reduce heat to medium. Continue cooking until water evaporates and bottoms are browned and crunchy, 1 or 2 minutes. Transfer to a warm serving dish. Repeat with remaining pot stickers. Serve with dipping sauce. </li>
    </ol>
